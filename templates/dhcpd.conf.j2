# is evaluated once after reading the dhcpd.conf file, rather than each
# time a client is assigned an IP address, so there is no way to use
# different DNS update styles for different clients. The default is
# nonrent DNS update styles for different clients. The default is none.

# The first point to understand about this style of DNS update is that
# unlike the ad-hoc style, the DHCP server does not necessarily always
# update both the A and the PTR records. The FQDN option includes a flag
# which, when sent by the client, indicates that the client wishes to
# update its own A record. In that case, the server can be configured
# either to honor the clientâ€™s intentions or ignore them. This is
# done with the statement allow client-updates; or the statement ignore
# client-updates;. By default, client updates are allowed.
